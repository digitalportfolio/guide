# Adding Projects

Using a Github Pages site is a great way to showcase technical projects. When citing technical projects, first you should include a high level description of the project and the goals it helped achieve. You can then include either a short description or list any technical details of the project you potentially want to highlight i.e. impressive parts of the project you want to draw attention to. If code based, you can also include a code block of some of the important code if there is something specific you want to showcase and it is not too long. You can also link any external resources related to the project, potentially including papers, presentations, or other visual artifacts. Finally, you should add a link to the github repository where the project can be found so that any interested parties can go through the code in detail. 

## Exercise: How to Represent your Project

**What is the project?**
Is it easy for the audience to understand what the project is? Why did you undertake this project? If your project is for an end user, you could include an explanation of why the project matters and a user need statement. Think about what you can use to help illustrate this project. For example, if you have designed an autonomous robot, you could include a video demo as well as technical drawings for your designed, and a link to the GitHub repository where you have programmed its behaviour. If you designed a video game, you could imbed the game itself on your digital portfolio, or include video recordings of game play.

**What did you do?**
What was your contribution to the project? Was it individual, or a team effort? If it was a team project, which sections were you responsible for?
How did you implement this project / your section of the project? Explain choices you made in design and implementation.

**Who is the audience?**
In most cases, you should consider your audience to be someone without a technical background. When applying to jobs, your Digital Portfolio may be looked at by a manager or member of human resources. Will your content be easy to understand if someone is not familiar with the subject? Think about your use of jargon and technical language.

**What did you learn from the project?**
Why did you make certain decisions, what skills did you take away from completing this project?

**What was the impact of the project?**
Can you describe the impact of the project in some way? For example, if you have designed and implemented an app, how many users do you have? If you designed an engine for Cornell Car, how much more efficient was it than the previous version?
