# About Us

This project was created by Parker Feinerman, Gabrielle Haam and James Weaver. 
This guide was developed for Cornell University College of Engineering students.

Digital presence has become increasingly important - we created this guide to help you to create your Digital Portolio. Here you can shape your online presence: express what you are interested in, what you have experience in and showcase your projects.

For more information on the background of this project, please see our accompanying [project doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19fYCHzOdSQVq3GkSzhW7a2YKzukKsoIeY5CcnJqOymg/edit?usp=sharing).
