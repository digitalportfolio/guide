From your repository, go to Settings.

## Editing Pages

Your GitHub page can be edited in Markdown, a lightweight markup language. We have compiled a cheat sheet of some basic Markdown syntax to get you started with editing your page and adding content. 


# Markdown Cheat Sheet

## Formatting Text
### Headings
In Markdown, you can use Heading Styles with a number of # symbols, followed by a space.
Example:
```
### The text here will be rendered in style Heading 1
```
> ### Heading 3



```
## The text here will be rendered in style Heading 2
```
> ## Heading 2



```
**bold text here**
```
> **bold text here**



```
*italic text here*
```
> *italic text here*



```
***bold and italic text here***
```
> ***bold and italic text here***


### Bullet Points
Use - to denote a bullet point
```
  - point a
  - point b
  - point c
```
- point a
- point b
- point c

### Blockquotes
Text can be put into a block quote section by beginning the line with the > symbol followed by a space.

```
> the text here will render in a block quotes
```
> this is how text in block quotes will appear

You can create multiline, and nested blockquote sections by using  > vs >>
```
> level 1
> level 1
>> level 2
```
> level 1
> level 1
>> level 2


### Code Blocks
If you indent code sections with a tab, they will appear as a codeblock in markdown.
You can also separate them by using three backticks before and after the code section




## Links and Images
### Clickable Links
```
<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>
```


### Adding a link to text
The word in square brackets will be linked to the address in brackets. The words in quotation marks are the title - they will appear when you hover over the link.
```
Click [Here](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/ "Cornell Engineering")
```
Click [Here](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/)
My favorite search engine is [Google](https://www.google.com "The best search engine")

### Adding Images
The text in quotation marks is the (optional) title - it will appear when the link is hovered over. The text in brackets is not displayed.
```
![The Cornell Campus!](https://www.cornell.edu/about/img/main-Tower1.Still001-720x.jpg "Cornell Campus")
```
![The Cornell Campus!](https://www.cornell.edu/about/img/main-Tower1.Still001-720x.jpg "Cornell Campus")

### Adding Videos
You can add videos with HTML, see code snippet here:
```
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source type="video/mp4" src="https://cuauv.org/static/media/CUAUV%20Hero%20Video.64b4eaf3.mp4">
</video>
```
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source type="video/mp4" src="https://cuauv.org/static/media/CUAUV%20Hero%20Video.64b4eaf3.mp4">
</video>


## Troubleshooting
If you need to escape a character, you can use backslash (e.g. if you want to write a number followed by a ‘.’, to prevent it from being detected as a numbered list).

You can also use HTML in your markdown file between tags
For example:
```
This <em>word</em> is italic. 
```
Would produce the same effect as:
```
This *word* is italic.
```
> This *word* is italic.

If you are unsure how to format or add content, and need more info on Markdown you can search on their [website](https://www.markdownguide.org/)


# Creating Content

If you are not sure how to start adding content to your digital portfolio, you can use your Resume as a starting point. For help with your resume, you can check out the Cornell Career Services [Resume Prep Page](https://scl.cornell.edu/get-involved/career-services/resumes-and-interview-prep/resumes) or the Cornell Engineering Career Services ["Build A Better Resume"](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/departments/career%20services/Build%20A%20Better%20Resume-%20Technical-%20Fall%202017.ppt) Guide.

## Your Bio

You will likely want to include an “About Me” or “Bio” page. Here you can summarize who you are, what you are working on and what you are interested in.

You could include information on the following:
- Background
- Education
- Current Work
- Areas of Professional Interest
- Personal Interests / Hobbies 

Once you have your bio, pop it onto your GitHub repository. You can add links in markdown like this:
```
